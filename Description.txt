** map() vs flatMap **

Java8 Stream API provides map and flatMap. 
Both these methods are intermediate methods and return another stream as a part of output.

map() -> map() method is use for transformation.
         map() takes the stream of data as input then it transform the data and return another stream as a output.
         at high level  Stream<R> map (Stream<T> input){}
         It processes stream of values
         It does only mapping (transformation)
         Its  mapper function produces a single value for each input value.
         It is a One to One mapping
         Use this function when the mapper function produces a single value for each input value.
         

flatMap() -> flatMap is use for transformation + flattening. (flatMap = map() + flattening)
             It processes stream of stream of values
             It does mapping (transformation) + flattening
             Its mapper produces multiple values for each input value.
             It is a One to many mapping
             Use this function when the mapper function produces multiple values for each input value.
